    <h1>Casserole</h1>
    <p>A casserole (French: diminutive of casse, from Provençal cassa 'pan'[1]) is a kind of large, deep pan or bowl
        used for cooking a variety of dishes in the oven;
        it is also a category of foods cooked in such a vessel.</p>
    <p> To distinguish the two uses, the pan can be called a "casserole dish" or "casserole pan", whereas the food is
        simply "a casserole".
        The same pan is often used both for cooking and for serving.</p>
